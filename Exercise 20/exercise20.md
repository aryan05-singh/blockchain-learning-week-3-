# **Problem Statement**:
 # Based on your enhanced ERC-20 token, conceptualize a decentralized banking platform. Users should be able to:
    1. Deposit traditional ERC-20 tokens and get an equivalent amount of "AdvancedToken" in return.
    2. Lend their "AdvancedToken" to earn interest.
    3. Borrow against their "AdvancedToken" holdings.

# Concept


Advanced Token will allow to  deposit and withdraw ERC-20 tokens, mint and burn AdvancedToken tokens, and lock and unlock AdvancedToken tokens.

Then a  contract will be initiated to manages lending and borrowing activities, allowing users to lend their Advanced Token.

 **Deposite** =  Allows users to deposit ERC-20 tokens and get an equivalent amount of AdvancedToken tokens in returns.
 
  **Withdraw** = Allows users to withdraw ERC-20 tokens by burning AdvancedToken tokens.

  **Mint** = allows to user mint tokens in Smart contracts.

  **Burn** = Allow to user burn tokens present in total supply.

  **Lock** = Lock token for specific time.

  **lendTokens**  =  Allows users to lend their Token to the bank and earn interest.

  **borrowTokens** = A user who wants to borrow tokens first deposits a certain amount of Token.Allows users to borrow against their AdvancedToken holdings.

  # **Define**:

  firstly a user deposits ERC 20 tokens into the AdvancedToken and given permission to return token.Then given permission to withdraw token.And user lend their Advanced Token  contract will transfer.Allowing users to lend their AdvancedToken and borrow against it with interest.Borrow tokens Against their AdvanceD TOKEN .
